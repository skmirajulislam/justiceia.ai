### Environment Variables Added:
1. **NEXTAUTH_URL** - Required for NextAuth to work properly

3. **NODE_ENV** - Required for environment-specific configurations

### Environment Variables Fixed:
1. **STRIPE_SECRET_KEY** - Removed extra space that was causing issues

## Build Status:
âœ… **TypeScript Compilation:** PASSED  
âœ… **Next.js Build:** PASSED  
âœ… **Development Server:** RUNNING  
âœ… **All API Endpoints:** FUNCTIONAL  

## What This Means:
- The application can now be built and deployed without environment variable errors
- All authentication, file upload, payment, and database features should work
- The role system refactor is fully operational
- Ready for development, testing, and production deployment

## For Production Deployment:
Update these variables in your production environment:
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` â†’ Your production domain (e.g., https://yourdomain.com)
- `NODE_ENV` â†’ "production"
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` â†’ Use live Stripe keys instead of test keys
- Consider using environment-specific database URLs

## Security Notes:
- All secrets are properly configured
- JWT tokens are using secure random secrets
- Database connection is using SSL
- Ready for secure production deployment
